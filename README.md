My [Launchbar](http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html) Scripts
=====================

Most useful
-----------
* **Share Dropbox** - Pass it a file or a folder and get a dropbox public url. If you don't pass anything it will share a screenshot instead. You can specify the name of the screenshot by pressing space instead of return.
* **Timer** - Enter a time interval followed by an optional message i.e. "15m6s pizza" and receive an alert after the time has passed.
* **Haste** - Pass it some text or a file and receive a hastebin.com public url.
* **Short goo.gl** - Shorten a url with goo.gl.
* **Show External Address** - Find out the ip address you are using on the internet.

Others
---------
* **~~Color Picker~~** - Instead just save an applescript containing `choose color` as **Color Picker.app**. With [Hex Color Picker](http://wafflesoftware.net/hexpicker/) it becomes a better alternative to **DigitalColor Meter.app**
* **Chat** - Enter the name of a contact and a chat window will open in Adium
* **Short tinyarrow.ws** - Shorten a url with tinyarrow.ws url shortener.

Personal stuff
-------------------------
* Mount Media - used to mount a specific firewire drive.
* Toggle Audio Output - Used to Toggle between default audio output and bluetooth wireless connected to my hi-fi.



Installing

__You need to edit the dropbox id inside the script Share Dropbox.applescript for it to work. You can find the id by looking at the url of one of yout public files i.e. "http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/4204196/example.png"__
